B06Y39Q9FF,"After purchasing the ""3 Tube"" lamp; I went on to get the ""Shark"" and the ""Jellyfish"" lamps and neither had the USB or battery power sources. Also they didn't have the touch button to change the colors. Still a cool little light sculptures but I got a definite sense of El Cheapo. If this doesn't bother you then go ahead with the purchase. For my use, the USB &a battery setup was a major consideration, and I probably would not have bought the other 2 had I known, but all 3 models were in the same product description.",Disappointed,"Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2017",True,3.0
