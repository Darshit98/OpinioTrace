B09G9FPHY6,"In the product summary there are clearly pictures of the Apple Pen and Apple keyboard.  Under ""About this item"", it includes a detailed description of the Apple pen and keyboard.  Then at the very end of that paragraph include a statement ""accessories not included"".  Why describe it in ""about this item"" if they are not included?  Why not add a case, a screen protector, and a backup battery in there and say ""not included""?  It's a little odd...and a little misleading I think.  I looked up other iPads for sale and none of them included a description of accessories under ""about this item"" because they were not included.That is my only criticism of the posting of the item.

B09G9FPHY6,"This Apple 🍎 iPad 9th generation is very competent and does everything I want it to do.  I don’t do anything really super complicated with it (mostly streaming 🎥 movies, surfing 🏄‍♂️ the net, and of course, ✍️ writing product reviews 🤪😁😜😛😆) so it’s fine for my needs.

The 👁️ retina display touchscreen is a pretty decent size at 10.2 inches (diagonally).  The touchscreen is sharp, vivid, true to color, and very responsive.  Also, this iPad came with a 20W USB-C power adapter, USB-C to lightning charge cable, and 3 months free Apple TV+.  The Apple TV+ is great because I have been able to watch the ⚽️ soccer/football⚽️ show, Ted Lasso, for FREE.  👍😁👍  Score!!!!!  ⚽️🥅⚽️  Apple 🍏 makes excellent, quality electronics, and this handheld computer is absolutely no exception.  👍🍏😃🍎  The only things I wish were different about this iPad are the slow charging speed and the battery drains a little faster than I would like.

I would like to buy the 10th generation iPad, but it’s just too pricey and expensive for me.  This is a much more budget-friendly option.

But each one didn't last long before running so slow I had to replace it.  Meanwhile, my old iPhone 5 was still working great as a music and sleep machine audio device for our bedroom.  I finally decided to step up to THIS iPad back in 2021.  WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG!!!!!!  First, it is still blazingly fast and will be for basic tasks like I use it for a decade or more.  I won't have to replace this for a very very long time.  Second.....the user experience is incredible, just like an iPhone or Macbook.

My ONLY complaint with this order is that it took about 2 weeks to be delivered rather than a couple of days.

B09G9FPHY6,"My old Ipad Pro hasn’t worked for over a year and I also needed a new computer -  but didn’t need anything as sophisticated as a Mac so thought I would try out this 9th Gen Ipad.  So far it does most of what I would do with a larger laptop and has a touchscreen.  I was reluctant to buy Apple tech for quite a few years until I bought a small Iphone SE about 4 years ago - switched from a Samsung Galaxy..  The SE was a great size to carry around the city and it fit in most pockets and had great reception.  It was and still is a great piece of technology.  I upgraded to a 12 after 2 years and still use the SE around the house because it connects to wifi.  The 12 had a better camera and I had toddler granddaughters and after another 2 years I upgraded to the 14 PROMax which has a great camera, larger screen and is not unlike the SE except the bigger size to view photos.  I really love the touchscreen feature for NYTimes games and other interactive apps.  I worry about having most of my pictures on this technology because they could move to a more sophisticated system and make these obsolete - which is a concern. My daughter’s Iphone 13 fell in the snow a few years ago and she somehow lost all her pictures that she thought were in the cloud.  I held on to my 12 because it holds quite a bit of what she lost since we shared their photos.  Neither of us is sure why this happened and if it could happen again.  If I have a stand alone camera it isn’t convenient but I have the photos detached from the technology and the whims of a large multinational behemoth.  So far I am happy with the Ipad and am still learning how to use it.  I found a case that closes securely and  can stand in portrait or landscape mode which is really nice when viewing Netflix or AppleTV.  If you need a new computer to carry conveniently this Ipad is the way to go unless you really need the power and graphic abilities of the MAC.  My Iphone 14maxpro has 256g of memory and I barely use 100 so I thought I would only need 64g on the Ipad since my phone has the extra capacity.  Not convinced this was a great decision but some of my Iphone content can stay there exclusively  so it might just work out.  Or not…..",Nice IPad.

B09G9FPHY6,"This is my first Apple device. I have always felt their products were overpriced. Now in our economy everything is overpriced. The iPad is the only Apple device that I have even considered purchasing. I have several other brand tablets/laptops but just couldn't pass this up because of the good price. After hearing people praise Apple devices over other brands, there was a lot of hype to live up to. Bottom line, it was a little underwhelming, because of the hype. Taking the device at face value though, this is an excellent device. The pros: the processor and the battery life. I've been using it for over a month. This is the entry level iPad 9th gen but the A13 bionic chip is fast and able to handle multitasking very easily. Granted I only use this device really for entertainment(games, watching videos), browsing the web, checking emails, so I don't use it all day/every day. The battery lasts me a couple of days without charging. Even after watching videos for several hours I still don't have to charge it. The bezels make holding the device easier without blocking the screen. And because of it's 4:3 aspect ratio compared to other tablets 16:10 it makes watching videos/reading a more pleasant experience. I did buy a third party pencil to use with it. It works well for taking notes, there is a audible tap when using the pencil. I don't have any cons-the gestures take some getting used to. I just prefer other brands gestures, they seem more intuitive and useful to me. The screen is nice but it's not noticeably better than any of my other devices.

I had stopped using it years ago and grew accustomed to using my iPhone and multiple Mac computers instead.  However, several months back I decided to explore streaming music with a WiiM Pro and felt I needed a larger screen than my iPhone to control the WiiM and read about the music I was listening to via Qobuz.  So I decided to get a new iPad but didn’t need a laptop replacement (i.e., lots of processing power), or cutting edge screen.  And I wanted a “Goldilocks” size.  At around $250 this 9th Gen iPad is a fantastic bargain.It doesn’t have the heft or quality feel of my 3rd Gen, which is made out of steel, but it seems well put together.  The screen is only a tiny, tiny bit better but for what I do the screen is fine.  It’s plenty bright and responsive.  And, of course, it runs every app I choose to use flawlessly.  A few attributes blow me away, however.  Even with what’s now a slightly older processor (A13) it is very fast.  Battery life is staggering.  This iPad is so satisfying, I have switched my usage away from my phone, and even my TV’s to it.  It’s fantastic as a control device for the WiiM, great for recreational web surfing, and I have been using it as a display device for Xfinity Stream to watch local TV.

B09G9FPHY6,"I have owned several iPads over the years and upgraded to this model after the new, highly over priced, iPad 10th generation model was released, Biggest gripe is this has the shortest battery life of any model I ever owned. Also, it will extremely slow if you use older charge cables so you must only use the newer cable. Aside from the poor battery life, this is a good product except that the screen is reflective, unlike iPads of a few generations earlier. The reflective screen was introduced a few years ago to help leverage the user to spend a lot more. Without lights in the background, the reflective screen is not a big issue, with lights it can be a minor annoyance.","Good Product, Poor Battery life","Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2023",True,4.0

B09G9FPHY6,"I have had my iPad 9th Generation 64GB Wi-Fi since the end of November, 2022. It has been about 5 months. I upgraded from an iPad Air 2 32GB Wi-Fi (2014 model) that I had for almost 6 years! I have to say that there is a reason why Apple iPads are sold at such a premium price. That's because they provide valuable practical use for far longer than the vast majority of what is available in the tablet market.With that said the 2021 iPad 9th Generation is a base iPad with a limited amount of fancy features and a dated iPad design. Quite frankly, I actually use my iPad on the go and all of the iPads I have had go directly into an Otterbox Defender case. So I hardly notice the little aesthetics in design when my iPads area always in an Otterbox Defender case.I won't make this review long and will highlight the particular reason why I feel the need to write this review at all. I would say there's three top reasons why I believe the iPad 9th generation is excellent: 1. Good CPU performance/64GB base memory capacity, 2. Value pricing, and 3. Apple Pencil/Freeform.1. CPU performance is good with the A13 CPU from the iPhone 11. I am confident that I will be able to use this iPad for at least 4 more years, if not 5. I bought my iPad Air 2 (2014 model) in 2016 and it was supported with OS updates up until iPadOS 15, which is a total of 8 years. But the iPad Air 2 was among the longest supported iPads in Apple's tablet history. So it is not likely to be repeated. But I think that the iPad 9th generation should be supported for at least 6 years, 2021 to 2027. Plus, the 64GB base capacity is excellent for my basic use of the iPad.2. The pricing for the iPad 9th Generation 64GB retails at $329.99, but it is often for sale at $269.99. That's how much I purchased it for during Cyber Monday 2022. It has been on sale for as low as $249.99 at some other retailers as well. So overall, the pricing is very affordable for a device this capable with support for many years to come.3. I know that the Apple Pencil has been out for years, but I have only now tried it. It was not supported with my iPad Air 2 (2014 model) and I never gave it much thought as being useful to me. I always thought that the Apple Pencil was geared towards artists, which to some extent it is. I tried the Apple Pencil on my iPad 9th Generation about a month after getting mine. It was a revolutionary experience for me. I have been looking for a viable substitute for a whiteboard for the longest time. But there is not any real replacement for what you can do on a whiteboard. The Apple Pencil with FreeForm is the closest that I've come to the experience I get on a whiteboard. Although, I do still use a 4'x8' whiteboard for some brainstorming sessions, the Apple Pencil has afforded me to do some basic brainstorming in FreeForm. This is a massive benefit and I can only see Apple getting better with its FreeForm app. Not to mention app developers releasing new apps to take advantage of the Apple Pencil for brainstorming on a virtual whiteboard.Overall, I highly recommend the iPad 9th Generation.","Apple does it again, the best of Apple in a great price!","Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2023",True,5.0

B09G9FPHY6,"I have had my iPad 9th Generation 64GB Wi-Fi since the end of November, 2022. It has been about 5 months. I upgraded from an iPad Air 2 32GB Wi-Fi (2014 model) that I had for almost 6 years! I have to say that there is a reason why Apple iPads are sold at such a premium price. That's because they provide valuable practical use for far longer than the vast majority of what is available in the tablet market.With that said the 2021 iPad 9th Generation is a base iPad with a limited amount of fancy features and a dated iPad design. Quite frankly, I actually use my iPad on the go and all of the iPads I have had go directly into an Otterbox Defender case. So I hardly notice the little aesthetics in design when my iPads area always in an Otterbox Defender case.I won't make this review long and will highlight the particular reason why I feel the need to write this review at all. I would say there's three top reasons why I believe the iPad 9th generation is excellent: 1. Good CPU performance/64GB base memory capacity, 2. Value pricing, and 3. Apple Pencil/Freeform.1. CPU performance is good with the A13 CPU from the iPhone 11. I am confident that I will be able to use this iPad for at least 4 more years, if not 5. I bought my iPad Air 2 (2014 model) in 2016 and it was supported with OS updates up until iPadOS 15, which is a total of 8 years. But the iPad Air 2 was among the longest supported iPads in Apple's tablet history. So it is not likely to be repeated. But I think that the iPad 9th generation should be supported for at least 6 years, 2021 to 2027. Plus, the 64GB base capacity is excellent for my basic use of the iPad.2. The pricing for the iPad 9th Generation 64GB retails at $329.99, but it is often for sale at $269.99. That's how much I purchased it for during Cyber Monday 2022. It has been on sale for as low as $249.99 at some other retailers as well. So overall, the pricing is very affordable for a device this capable with support for many years to come.3. I know that the Apple Pencil has been out for years, but I have only now tried it. It was not supported with my iPad Air 2 (2014 model) and I never gave it much thought as being useful to me. I always thought that the Apple Pencil was geared towards artists, which to some extent it is. I tried the Apple Pencil on my iPad 9th Generation about a month after getting mine. It was a revolutionary experience for me. I have been looking for a viable substitute for a whiteboard for the longest time. But there is not any real replacement for what you can do on a whiteboard. The Apple Pencil with FreeForm is the closest that I've come to the experience I get on a whiteboard. Although, I do still use a 4'x8' whiteboard for some brainstorming sessions, the Apple Pencil has afforded me to do some basic brainstorming in FreeForm. This is a massive benefit and I can only see Apple getting better with its FreeForm app. Not to mention app developers releasing new apps to take advantage of the Apple Pencil for brainstorming on a virtual whiteboard.Overall, I highly recommend the iPad 9th Generation.","Apple does it again, the best of Apple in a great price!","Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2023",True,5.0
B09G9FPHY6,Has lots of storage for all my toddlers games. Easy to find and has a very large bulky size but hey she doesn’t carry it far enough to break it. So we leave it where she lays. Could have got the mini but been burned by how easy that was to carry with my first kiddo. Too heavy to hold up that’s the only downfall. So she leans down if holding but everyone does that anyways. We just prop it up and when she’s tired she rolls away from it at night. Because she’s not holding it so close to her face she stays on it a way more appropriate amount of time for a kid.,Great product at a great price,"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2023",True,5.0
