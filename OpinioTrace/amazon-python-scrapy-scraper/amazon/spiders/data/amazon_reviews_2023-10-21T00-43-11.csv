She’s in her 70s and needs it for getting on the Internet and Facebook and keeping in touch with her friends and of course, her pictures and videos. It has more than enough and I mean more than enough storage for what she needs it for. why spend all that money for all that storage when you don’t need it? So happy with my purchase!

B09G9FPHY6,"In the product summary there are clearly pictures of the Apple Pen and Apple keyboard.  Under ""About this item"", it includes a detailed description of the Apple pen and keyboard.  Then at the very end of that paragraph include a statement ""accessories not included"".  Why describe it in ""about this item"" if they are not included?  Why not add a case, a screen protector, and a backup battery in there and say ""not included""?  It's a little odd...and a little misleading I think.  I looked up other iPads for sale and none of them included a description of accessories under ""about this item"" because they were not included.That is my only criticism of the posting of the item.  Other than that, it was a good value for the money, scratch and dent free, and seemed to be operating perfectly.  It arrived fast (same day) which is good because I needed it quickly for a work project.",Good value for the money,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2023",True,4.0

B09G9FPHY6,I use my iPad all the time since I don’t have a computer. My old one was at least six years old and the battery was pretty much gone and I had to keep it plugged in all the time to be able to use it. I had been putting off replacing it but decided the time and price were right. It’s easy to set up a replacement because all my stuff is in my Icloud account.

B09G9FPHY6,"This Apple 🍎 iPad 9th generation is very competent and does everything I want it to do.  I don’t do anything really super complicated with it (mostly streaming 🎥 movies, surfing 🏄‍♂️ the net, and of course, ✍️ writing product reviews 🤪😁😜😛😆) so it’s fine for my needs.  Without a case, it’s just over a pound (so not that heavy).  It has fast connectivity and is intuitively, user-friendly.  The 👁️ retina display touchscreen is a pretty decent size at 10.2 inches (diagonally).  The touchscreen is sharp, vivid, true to color, and very responsive.  Also, this iPad came with a 20W USB-C power adapter, USB-C to lightning charge cable, and 3 months free Apple TV+.  The Apple TV+ is great because I have been able to watch the ⚽️ soccer/football⚽️ show, Ted Lasso, for FREE.  👍😁👍  Score!!!!!  ⚽️🥅⚽️  Apple 🍏 makes excellent, quality electronics, and this handheld computer is absolutely no exception.  👍🍏😃🍎  The only things I wish were different about this iPad are the slow charging speed and the battery drains a little faster than I would like.  I use the iPad while it’s charging and that slows down the charging speed.  I purchased this iPad for about $200 plus tax (free shipping, on sale, and had a gift card too).  I would like to buy the 10th generation iPad, but it’s just too pricey and expensive for me.  This is a much more budget-friendly option.  Long story short, I really like this iPad and am very happy with this purchase.  Because of its excellent qualities, it’s going to be very useful to me, and I think 🤔 it will last a long time.  I am impressed by it and highly recommend it (especially if money is a factor).  👍🍏🤪❤️😃🍎👍🍏😎🤔🍏👍❤️😝⭐️🩷🍎👍",🍎 Excellent Quality 🍏 Value 🍎 Sharp Retina Display 🍏 User Friendly 🍎🤪🍏❤️😃😎❤️🍏,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2023",True,5.0

B09G9FPHY6,"For over a decade, I thought anyone who spent the money on an iPad was an idiot.  I bought one Android tablet after another because they were cheap and ""just as good"".  But each one didn't last long before running so slow I had to replace it.  Meanwhile, my old iPhone 5 was still working great as a music and sleep machine audio device for our bedroom.  I finally decided to step up to THIS iPad back in 2021.  WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG!!!!!!  First, it is still blazingly fast and will be for basic tasks like I use it for a decade or more.  I won't have to replace this for a very very long time.  Second.....the user experience is incredible, just like an iPhone or Macbook.

B09G9FPHY6,"It is a new iPad, in an unopened box. Would not expect it to be anything other than great Apple quality, which it is. My ONLY complaint with this order is that it took about 2 weeks to be delivered rather than a couple of days. I’m sure that has something to do with logistics and how Amazon buys stock and sells genuine Apple new (rather than “refreshed”) electronics and there was no huge rush, just a disconnect between the usual Amazon speed of fulfillment and the experience with this purchase. Nevertheless, the savings made it all worth it. And I love my new iPad.","Better than Apple, because it was less expensive than Apple","Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2023",True,5.0

B09G9FPHY6,"My old Ipad Pro hasn’t worked for over a year and I also needed a new computer -  but didn’t need anything as sophisticated as a Mac so thought I would try out this 9th Gen Ipad.  So far it does most of what I would do with a larger laptop and has a touchscreen.  I was reluctant to buy Apple tech for quite a few years until I bought a small Iphone SE about 4 years ago - switched from a Samsung Galaxy..  The SE was a great size to carry around the city and it fit in most pockets and had great reception.  It was and still is a great piece of technology.  I upgraded to a 12 after 2 years and still use the SE around the house because it connects to wifi.  The 12 had a better camera and I had toddler granddaughters and after another 2 years I upgraded to the 14 PROMax which has a great camera, larger screen and is not unlike the SE except the bigger size to view photos.  I really love the touchscreen feature for NYTimes games and other interactive apps.  I worry about having most of my pictures on this technology because they could move to a more sophisticated system and make these obsolete - which is a concern. My daughter’s Iphone 13 fell in the snow a few years ago and she somehow lost all her pictures that she thought were in the cloud.  I held on to my 12 because it holds quite a bit of what she lost since we shared their photos.  Neither of us is sure why this happened and if it could happen again.  If I have a stand alone camera it isn’t convenient but I have the photos detached from the technology and the whims of a large multinational behemoth.  So far I am happy with the Ipad and am still learning how to use it.  I found a case that closes securely and  can stand in portrait or landscape mode which is really nice when viewing Netflix or AppleTV.  If you need a new computer to carry conveniently this Ipad is the way to go unless you really need the power and graphic abilities of the MAC.  My Iphone 14maxpro has 256g of memory and I barely use 100 so I thought I would only need 64g on the Ipad since my phone has the extra capacity.  Not convinced this was a great decision but some of my Iphone content can stay there exclusively  so it might just work out.  Or not…..",Nice IPad.

B09G9FPHY6,"This is my first Apple device. I have always felt their products were overpriced. Now in our economy everything is overpriced. The iPad is the only Apple device that I have even considered purchasing. I have several other brand tablets/laptops but just couldn't pass this up because of the good price. After hearing people praise Apple devices over other brands, there was a lot of hype to live up to. Bottom line, it was a little underwhelming, because of the hype. Taking the device at face value though, this is an excellent device. The pros: the processor and the battery life. I've been using it for over a month. This is the entry level iPad 9th gen but the A13 bionic chip is fast and able to handle multitasking very easily. Granted I only use this device really for entertainment(games, watching videos), browsing the web, checking emails, so I don't use it all day/every day. The battery lasts me a couple of days without charging. Even after watching videos for several hours I still don't have to charge it. The bezels make holding the device easier without blocking the screen. And because of it's 4:3 aspect ratio compared to other tablets 16:10 it makes watching videos/reading a more pleasant experience. I did buy a third party pencil to use with it. It works well for taking notes, there is a audible tap when using the pencil. I don't have any cons-the gestures take some getting used to. I just prefer other brands gestures, they seem more intuitive and useful to me. The screen is nice but it's not noticeably better than any of my other devices. Again this is the entry level iPad so for the price I think this is an excellent device. It should be able to handle most things you throw at it.
